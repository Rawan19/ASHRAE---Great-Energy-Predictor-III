# ASHRAE---Great-Energy-Predictor-III

*This is the final project for the  machine learning course.*
## Problem: How much energy will a building consume?

Data: https://www.kaggle.com/c/ashrae-energy-prediction/data
Required:
- Full EDA
- Features Engineering
- Data pipeline: Use all variables types(numbers, text)
- Evaluate at least 3 models
- Use CV
- Tune the model(s) hyperparameters with GridSearchCV, RandomSearchCV
- Improve using Model Ensembles
- Deploy the model: develop a standalone pipeline

(Bonus) Deployment: Any of the following:
- Colab : standalone notebook that gets the saved model and makes prediction
